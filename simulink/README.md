# Linear MPC in Simulink using YALMIP
This example shows how to use a linear MPC controller formulated with YALMIP in Simulink.

It was inspired by [a similar example with CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/blog/mpc-simulink/).

More information can be found in the [MATLAB System block documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/what-is-matlab-system-block.html).
