# Linear MPC using YALMIP
This example shows how to formulate a linear MPC problem using [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/).

A linear MPC formulation usually has a quadratic objective, linear system dynamics and simple bounds on states or inputs.

The example was based on the quadcopter model and MPC formulation from [OSQP's website](https://osqp.org/docs/examples/mpc.html).
